## React Home Barista Project

A React App where I keep track of all my coffee things.

## About the project

As an avid home barista, I wanted to create a place where I can easily store and access data about my favorite coffee beans and tools.<br><br>

## Backend

I used Node.js to create models and routes for

- Registering a user
- Logging in a user
- Storing a quiz profile
- Creating, updating and deleting a coffee collection
- Creating, updating and deleting a tool collection (code to be uploaded soon)
- Creating, updating and deleting a recipe collection (code to be uploaded soon)
- Commenting (code to be uploaded soon)
