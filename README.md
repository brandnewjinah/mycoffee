## React Home Barista Project

A React App where I keep track of all my coffee things.

## About the project

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandnewjinah/mycoffee/main/frontend/src/assets/home.png" alt="button" width="700"/>

As an avid home barista, I wanted to create a place where I can easily store and access data about my favorite coffee beans and tools.<br><br>

## Backend

I used Node.js to create models and routes for

- Registering a user
- Logging in a user
- Storing a quiz profile
- Creating, updating and deleting a coffee collection
- Creating, updating and deleting a tool collection (code to be uploaded soon)
- Creating, updating and deleting a recipe collection (code to be uploaded soon)
- Commenting (code to be uploaded soon)

## Frontend

I used React, partially TypeScript and Redux to create frontend.

### Quiz

### Collection

### Tools

### Recipe

### User
